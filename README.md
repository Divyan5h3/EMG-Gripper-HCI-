# EMG-Gripper-HCI-
I made a device which recorded hand signals using an EMG sensor and then output it to a robotic gripper, which I made using kirigami. I coded this project in Python and Arduino. On a larger scale, this EMG gripper, normally used in robotic surgery, could be used as a prosthetic arm or on machines to lift heavy objects such as a mechanical gripper to pick up garbage
